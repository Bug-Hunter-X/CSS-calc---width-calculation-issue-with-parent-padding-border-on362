To fix the issue, set the `box-sizing` property to `border-box` on the parent element. This makes the padding and border included in the element's total width, so `calc()` will work as expected.  Here's the corrected code:

```css
.parent {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid #ccc;
}

.selector {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

By setting `box-sizing: border-box;`, the `calc(100% - 20px)` will now correctly account for the padding and border of the parent element.
